# Turing Machine On Crack

A software re-imagining of Tom Whitwell / Music Thing Modular's Turing Machine random looping sequencer, plus Voltages and Pulses expanders.

Based on an ESP32 microcontroller and featuring four 12-bit DAC outputs, one 8-bit DAC output with analog scale and offset and an inverting output, and eight gate/trigger outputs

Uses FreeRTOS and my SequencerTools library.
